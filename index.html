    <h1 id="he">Text to Image Creation</h1>
    <h3>We can create customized pictures by giving customized ideas.</h3>
    <h2 id="hp">Project</h2>
    <p>Our project brings your words to life by turning text into images using advanced AI. Just describe what you want, and the system creates accurate, creative visuals in seconds. It's fast, easy to use, and perfect for marketing, design, and more!</p>
    
    <h2 id="hf">Features</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Text-to-Image Generation</li>
        <li>AI-Powered Understanding</li>
        <li>High-Quality Visuals</li>
        <li>Fast and Easy-to-Use</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="hw">How it Works</h2>
    <p>Using Azure AI services, our system converts text into images by analyzing the input with NLP to understand context. The processed data is then passed to Azure Machine Learning models to generate high-quality images. With Azure Functions for scalability and Blob Storage for secure image handling, the system ensures fast and reliable results, whether in the cloud or at the edge with Azure IoT Edge.</p>

    <h2 id="tech">Technology Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Azure Services to Power the Project:</h3>
        <li>Azure Blob Storage: For storing and managing generated images</li>
        <li>Azure Machine Learning: For deploying and training AI models like GANs or diffusion models</li>
        <li>Azure Functions, Azure Cognitive Services: For serverless, scalable text analysis and image generation processing</li>
    </ul>
